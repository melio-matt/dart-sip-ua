registrator.dart
- Made a change that is for mobile devices to support when using push 
notifcations that means that despite sip_ua knowing it is currently
registered it will do another registration as otherwise the invite
for the incoming call will not be recieved
- changed to emit an event everytime a register happens and not just on
registration changes. Previously only the point above this was done, now
all platforms do it

rtc_session.dart
- added in a cache of _mediaContraints when we connect, answer or regegoiate
so that if an iceRestart is done then it is possible to use the same constraints
in the new offer that will result from the ice restart
- add some code that if an end attempt was made and the call had already ended
didn't error just accepted as result is the same
- exposed the iceRestart method to be called when we know the network has changed
- in iceRestart we create a new RTCPeerConnection
- _createRTCConnection checks ice status to prevent loops
- _createLocalDescription, removing event handlers as they cannot cross the native
boundary and also check to see if ice restart is required
- _sendReinvite changed where the success flag is checked in the onSucceeded callback
so it checks the value as it always returned as the success flag could never be null. The
same alteration has been done to _sendUpdate
- _sendUpdate also not altered but has changed a lot
- Added a second attempt when doing a reinvite and a check to make sure that if the socket 
isn’t currently connected then it will delay an attempt to allow it time to connect before 
trying.
- Session timers are now sensitive to sip_ua being informed that a reconnection attempt 
is being made and will make a second attempt before killing the session.
- The answer method now picks up an iceServer to use. 

sip_ua_helper.dart
- expose ua object with get
- store the Feature-Caps in the RegistrationState object and in the registered callback
the raw Feature-Caps is transfered fromn the event object to the state object
- exposed the underlying options that exist in the ua version to allow greate configuration


ua.dart
- added processFeatureCaps method
- processFeatureCaps called in registered method
- recieveRequest when handling nofifies correctly sends back a 481 message rather than
throwing an exception


sip_ua.dart
- add export of exceptions.dart


register_events.dart
- store the Feature-Caps in the EventRegistered object 

subscriber.dart
- _sendSubsequentSubscribe was sending the subscribe message twice and also
alter the cseq so it wasn't always using random values
- altered the code that checks for an expires time in the response and if not
present then uses a default value. 0 is valid as this will be present when
the app wants to unsubscribe.

sip_message.dart
- handled the Subscription-State parsing in the header as it can have additional information,
but for here this is stripped

grammar.dart
- altered exception to pass through extra information so we can see where the
error is coming from

websocket_dart_impl.dart
- catching errors and logging them rather than allowing them to bubble all the way to the top
